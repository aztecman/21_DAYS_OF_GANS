# 21_DAYS_OF_GANS
This repo is a journal of my progress experimenting with Generative Adversarial Networks in Python over a series of 21 days.
## Day 1: 
**Today's Progress:**
##### Reading: Explored the first 9 articles of [Jonathan Hui's GAN series on Medium](https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/gan-gan-series-2d279f906e7b)
##### Coding: modified the code to use cifar100 instead of MNIST

**Link to code:** [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v1cb2iYof5KSdbm6-j381csR1OCWtZaq)

**Results / Thoughts:**

![cifar100 color-results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aztecman/21_DAYS_OF_GANS/master/day1_cifar100_400EPOCHS_color.png)

##### My results are rather blurry, but I get the sense that they would improve with further training. Just before going to bed I discovered how to make them color! Well I guess sleep can wait another hour...

**Future Work:**
- Read the rest of Jonathan Hui's articles on Medium
- Read [NIPS 2016 Tutorial: Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00160)
- Reread [Open Questions About Generative Adversarial Networks](https://distill.pub/2019/gan-open-problems/)
- Code a simple GAN in pure Numpy
- Try generating flowers
- Explore CGANs and infoGANs
- Try out the GAN exercises from [Chapter 3 of Hands on Deep Learning for Games](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Deep-Learning-for-Games/tree/master/Chapter03/Chapter_3)

## Day 2: 
**Today's Progress:**
##### Reading: read the remaining articles from [Jonathan Hui's GAN series on Medium](https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/gan-gan-series-2d279f906e7b)
##### Coding: 
- modified WGAN code to display the images correctly, rather than bleached out
- tried 800 epochs (2X yesterday) for the DCGAN

**Link to code:** [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fMJKhZy788SMWKCdqemCNCXEC6qaVJ_u)

**Results / Thoughts:**

##### Today's results are basically crap. On the plus side there is always tomorrow

**Future Work:**
- Explore CGANs and ACGANs
- Generate some outer-space textures
- Generate Insects
- Generate Koi
- Generate Faces
- Generate UV maps for 3d objects

## Day 3: 
**Today's Progress:**
##### Coding: 
- Managed to get pytorch installed on my Windows 10 system
- Ran a DCGAN to generate fake celebrity faces using torch and my personal GPU
- Ran a CGAN successfully using the colab notebook environment provided by Google

**Link to code:** 

(see 'Resources' below; change batch size from 32 to 64)

**Results / Thoughts:**

![cgan mnist results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aztecman/21_DAYS_OF_GANS/master/day3_cgan_mnist.png)

##### Wow, today was an incredible success. I didn't make much in the way of changes to the code, except raising the batch size for the CGAN from 32 to 64. Some of the faces generated by the partially trained network are particularly interesting.

**Future Work:**
- Generate some magic cards - one approach would be to find faces in the cards and insert them into the celebrities dataset
- Learn the fundamentals of Pytorch.
- Run a CGAN in Pytorch
- Generate animals with a CGAN
- Generate galaxies with a CGAN
- Generate flowers with a CGAN
- Run an ACGAN in Pytorch (also in keras)

## Day 4:
**Today's Progress:**
##### Coding
- Successfully ran a conditional GAN on cifar10

**Link to code:** 

(see 'Resources' below; change batch size from 16 to 64, as well as increased the number of epochs from 20 to 200)

**Results / Thoughts:**

[results A](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aztecman/21_DAYS_OF_GANS/master/day4_A.png)
[results B](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aztecman/21_DAYS_OF_GANS/master/day4_B.png)

##### While I would hesitate to call them realistic, today's results are as good as I could reasonably hope to achieve. It was peculiar to watch the training, as I would not expect to see mode collapse between different classes, as I observed. I'm curious if this would manifest similarly in an ACGAN.

**Future Work:**
- Generate textures for a 3d model using a GAN (might require a research project)
- Generate some scifi art with a GAN
