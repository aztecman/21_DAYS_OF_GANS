# 21_DAYS_OF_GANS
This repo is a journal of my progress experimenting with Generative Adversarial Networks in Python over a series of 21 days.
## Day 1: 
**Today's Progress:**
##### Reading: Explored the first 9 articles of [Jonathan Hui's GAN series on Medium](https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/gan-gan-series-2d279f906e7b)
##### Coding: modified the code to use cifar100 instead of MNIST

**Link to code:** [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v1cb2iYof5KSdbm6-j381csR1OCWtZaq)

**Results / Thoughts:**

##### My results are rather blurry, but I get the sense that they would improve with further training. Just before going to bed I discovered how to make them color! Well I guess sleep can wait another hour...

**Future Work:**
#### - Read the rest of Jonathan Hui's articles on Medium
#### - Read [NIPS 2016 Tutorial: Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00160)
#### - Reread [Open Questions About Generative Adversarial Networks](https://distill.pub/2019/gan-open-problems/)
#### - Code a simple GAN in pure Numpy
#### - Try generating flowers
#### - Explore CGANs and infoGANs
#### - Try out the GAN exercises from [Chapter 3 of Hands on Deep Learning for Games](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Deep-Learning-for-Games/tree/master/Chapter03/Chapter_3)
